Fall 2025

## Homework directions

**Fork** this repository in Github. This will create a *copy* of the original repository to your personal Github account.

It has the same commit history, branches, etc., but the forked repository is under your *personal* account. You have full read/write permissions in your forked repository.

**Clone** the forked repository to local (put the repository in your cpsc298Nix directory).

**Pull** changes from remote to your local (to make sure everything is synced).

There is a file named `matrix.sh` in the repository. Make sure you have execution permissions for this file, then run the script (`./matrix.sh`).
