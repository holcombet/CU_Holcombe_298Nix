# CPSC/CENG298 - Intro to *Nix

Fall 2025

PLEASE READ THROUGH THE DIRECTIONS CAREFULLY BEFORE STARTING

## Homework directions

1. **Fork** this repository in Github. This will create a *copy* of the original repository to your personal Github account.

    The forked repository will have the same commit history, branches, etc., but the forked repository is under your *personal* account. You have full read/write permissions in your forked repository.

2. **Clone** the forked repository to local (put the repository in your cpsc298Nix directory).

    The steps for cloning this repository are basically the same specified for Assignment 6 (directions are [here](https://hackmd.io/@TallyHolcombe/SkkzZp11-e)).

    Specifically, copy the HTTPS address for this repository (click the Code button to get the address).

    In your `cpsc298Nix` directory, run the command: `git clone <HTTPS>`.
   
4. **Enter** the new repository (`cd CU_Holcombe_298Nix`)

5. **Pull** changes from remote to your local (to make sure everything is synced).

6. There is a file named `matrix.sh` in the repository. Make sure you have execution permissions for this file, then run the script (`./matrix.sh`) in the terminal.

7. Take a screenshot of what the script produces (it will terminate automatically, don't worry). 

8. Submit this screenshot to the Canvas Assignment "Assignment 7 -- Forking a Repository"
